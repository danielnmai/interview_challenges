# Miro Frontend Pairing Exercise

## Summary

Create a React app to show different Studio Ghibli characters.

## API Server

<https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com>

## Application Spec

* Upon loading the app, show a list of names of all characters in alphabetical
  order.
* When I click on a name, it should expand in place to reveal more details
  about that character.
* There should be a filter where I can filter by the gender of the characters

## During the Session

* Ask me questions.
* Use any resource you need to complete the task (e.g. Google, StackOverflow).
* It's more important to show me how you break down the problem than to finish
  the exercise.

## Some Tips

* Don't treat this like throwaway code, write it as if it's for production.
* Think about how you can make the important parts of your code testable.
