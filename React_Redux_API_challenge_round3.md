# Miro Frontend Take Home

## Summary

Create a React app to navigate Studio Ghibli information.

## API Server

<https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com>

## Application Requirements

* When I access the home page, I should see the different categories of
  information I have access to (pick 2 or 3 categories).
* When I visit each category, I should be presented with a list of summary
  information about each item in that category.
* When I click on a specific item, I should get the full detail of that item,
  including drill around capabilities to related items (e.g. from a film to its
  people).
* I should be able to favorite any item.
* I should be able to see a list of my favorites.
* Favorites do not need to persist beyond current session.
* I should be able to perform typeahead search of character names and film
  titles.

## Deliverables

* Zipfile of your local working copy (including git history) or URL to repo.
* URL to the deployed app (if you choose to deploy it).
* Instructions on how I can run the app locally.

## Notes

* The expectation is that you spend 4â€“8 hours on this exercise, but feel free
  to take more (or less) time.
* You don't have to implement all the features, but be prepared to talk
  about why.
* Usability counts for more than styling. But if it looks nice, it definitely
  helps.
